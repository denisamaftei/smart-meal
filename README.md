# Smart Meal
This project is an application that helps reduce food waste by allowing users to track their food inventory and receive recipe suggestions based on their current ingredients.<br><br> The app was created using Vue.js, Quasar, and Firebase.

## Features
The Smart Meal App includes the following features:

* User authentication and authorization
* Inventory management for tracking food items and expiration dates
* Recipe suggestions based on available ingredients
* Notifications for expiring food items
* Shopping list creation to plan and reduce food waste

Users can create a shopping list within the app to plan meals and reduce food waste.
